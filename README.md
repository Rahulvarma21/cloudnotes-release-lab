# cloudnotes-release-lab

Small, self-contained repo for a Cloud Computing debugging exercise covering
Terraform fundamentals, reusable modules, state/backends, and a containerized
microservice release. Everything here is designed to be validated/built
**locally at ₹0** — no live cloud account, no paid registry, no billing.

This repo is **intentionally broken with three planted faults**. Your job is
to find and fix them, then fill in `release-notes.md` with evidence.

## Intended design (how it should work once fixed)

### Terraform (`terraform/`)

- `main.tf` calls the reusable module in `terraform/modules/storage/` to
  create the bucket metadata resource — it should **not** hand-define a
  duplicate `local_file` resource for the same purpose.
- `variables.tf` / `outputs.tf` reference real, declared variable and module
  output names only.
- State stays local and isolated per environment. `backend.tf` declares an
  empty `local` backend, and each environment supplies its own state path via
  a partial backend config file:
  - `terraform/envs/dev/backend.hcl`
  - `terraform/envs/staging/backend.hcl`

  Each environment's `path` must point at its **own** state file — never
  share a path between environments.
- Only these commands are needed to work through this exercise. **Never run
  `terraform apply`**:

  ```bash
  terraform -chdir=terraform init
  terraform -chdir=terraform fmt -check
  terraform -chdir=terraform validate
  terraform -chdir=terraform plan
  ```

  `init` here only downloads the free `hashicorp/local` provider and sets up
  the default local backend (state stored on disk in `terraform/`) — no
  cloud account, credentials, or cost involved. If you only want to check
  syntax/module wiring without touching any backend/state at all, you can
  use `terraform init -backend=false`, but note `plan` requires a fully
  initialized backend.

- The `local` provider is used everywhere so `init`/`validate`/`plan` need no
  cloud credentials at all.

### Microservice boundary (`app/`)

CloudNotes is conceptually split into two services:

- **notes-service** — the API in `app/` (this repo), owning note CRUD and
  exposing `GET /health`.
- **auth-service** — (out of scope for this exercise) would own
  authentication/token issuance and be consumed by `notes-service` over
  HTTP.

For this lab only `notes-service` is runnable. `GET /health` should return
HTTP 200 with a small JSON body indicating status `ok`.

### Container build (`Dockerfile`)

Multi-stage build:

1. **`deps`** stage — installs npm dependencies.
2. **`runtime`** stage — copies only `node_modules` and app source from the
   `deps` stage, keeping the final image small. The runtime stage's
   `COPY --from=` must reference the `deps` stage by name.

```bash
docker build -t cloudnotes-api:0.1.0 .
docker compose up -d --build
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

### Secrets

`API_KEY` must **never** be hardcoded in the `Dockerfile` or `compose.yaml`.
Supply it at runtime via `.env` (copied from `.env.example`, gitignored) or a
Compose secret. `security/check.sh` does a quick local grep-based check for
hardcoded secrets and confirms `.env` is gitignored. If you have
[Trivy](https://trivy.dev/) installed you can optionally run
`trivy image cloudnotes-api:0.1.0` for a deeper scan — it is not required.

## The three faults

This repo ships with exactly three planted faults:

1. A Terraform/HCL reference/type fault that breaks `terraform validate`.
2. A reusable-module fault (hand-duplicated resource instead of a module
   call) combined with a state-isolation fault (two environments sharing one
   local backend path).
3. A container build fault (wrong `COPY --from=` stage name) combined with a
   hardcoded fake secret in the Dockerfile.

Fix all three, then document your diagnosis and fix in `release-notes.md`.

## Ground rules

- Local/mock-safe only: no real project IDs, cloud credentials, or live API
  keys anywhere in this repo.
- Use `terraform init -backend=false` / `fmt` / `validate` / `plan` only —
  never `terraform apply`.
- Never push images to a paid container registry. The `registry:2` service
  in `compose.yaml` is a free, local artifact store for practice only.
